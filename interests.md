While I am a graduate student and that takes up a majority of my time I do have
interests that I like to pursue in my free time. 

# Gaming
I am an avid gamer who mainly plays on the Xbox One for achievements but I do 
have a Nintendo Wii U as well as a large library of Steam games. 

If you are interested in my virtual exploits I have included a link to my 
Gamercard from TrueAchievements.com

# Music
I also am an active musician who tries to find any opportunity I can to play.
While I mainly play trumpet for churches I am also well practiced in piano and
often will assist with a summer music camp that I have help run for the last
12 years.

Here is a brief video of the High Point University pep band playing at a NASCAR
truck event that I was a member of.
