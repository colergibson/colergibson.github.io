Overall the class has been increadibly helpful for furthing my knowledge about
both technology and its practical implications. At the beginning of the year I
was worried that the class would be mainly lectures and history about how 
technology has developed over the years with a brief hands on portion sprinkled
throughout. I have to say that I prefer this layout of the class. I've always
been a better hands on learner and the ability to experiment and make mistakes 
helps me to gain a better understanding of the material.

I am also in a python programming class this semester so I particularly enjoy 
working from the command line through git and learning the basic terminal 
commands. While I was working on my undergraduate degree I took a C++ programming
class so reading files and directories through `cd` and `ls` was something that
I was very familiar with. I also find that using the command line for navigation
and the opening files through both `c9` and `nano` is something that I actual am
beginning to prefer over the traditional gui system as I find it much more 
intuitive than clicking through the menus.
