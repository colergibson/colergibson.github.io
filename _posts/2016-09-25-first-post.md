Overall the class has been increadibly helpful for furthing my knowledge about
both technology and its practical implications. At the beginning of the year I
was worried that the class would be mainly lectures and history about how 
technology has developed over the years with a brief hands on portion sprinkled
throughout. I have to say that I prefer this layout of the class. I've always
been a better hands on learner and the ability to experiment and make mistakes 
helps me to gain a better understanding of the material.
