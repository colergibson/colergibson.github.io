I attended the 3D Printing Introduction Workshop that was hosted by the 
Kenan Science Library's Makerspace. I was actually inspired to go to this event 
as I was watching the movie Small Soldiers and in it they highlighted a 
"superior technology" that reminded me of 3D printing that we do today. It's 
interesting that a highly advanced technology that was used by a fictional 
military armaments company in 1998 is now something that almost any individual 
can get access to and use today.

During the workshop we learned about the different types of printers that 
are available to use as well as what types of materials the printers can use to 
make 3D objects. We also went over how the objeccts are created through specific
file formats that the printer is able to read as well as some limitations on the 
printing process; such as weaknesses of materials and the effects of printing on
the objects design. I've been familiar with the concept of 3D printing but it 
was exciting to see exactly how they work and all the technology that goes into
each item.

After the event took place I was interested in seeing what was currently 
being done with 3D printing and I was astonished to find that many museums and 
archives are using the tools to create replicas of items to better preserve the
originals as well as increase access to the materials. In these cases the 
replica items would be used in displays and be allowed to be handed more 
frequently by human hands; something which the originals would not be typically
permitted to do. Another interesting use is that monuments are being fully 
recreated through 3D printing and photography. The example that I found was 
Palmyra's Arch of Triumph being recreated by using photographs that were taken
before the arch was destroyed by an act of terrorism. The possibilities for 
education and preservation of world history only increase when one incorporates
the technology that is available to us.
