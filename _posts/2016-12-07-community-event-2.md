On November 4th there was a workshop for BitCurator hosted by Cal Lee. This 
workshop was to introduce what BitCurator was and to explain the importance of 
it. I was familiar with BitCurator as I had taken an archives class the previous
semester and our professor spent a class talking about it. I had a class during 
the first portion of the event but I was able to make it to the presentation a 
little later in.

Before I was there the presentation covered the history of BitCurator and the 
need for the program. The  portion of the presentation that I was there for was
they showed some example of what BitCurator could do. This ranged from which 
files you would use as well as how much data had been corrupted with each 
transfer. They also let us experiment with BitCurator by running reports on the 
disk image which gave us the information that we were searching for.

The class was pretty interesting from a hands on portion as it allowed me to 
learn more about what exactly BitCurator was than the brief time I had in my 
previous class with it. I would argue that this type of environment is the best 
to learn a new type of software as you can’t really comprehend what is happening
by slides and lecture alone. Overall I’m not sure how often I will use this new 
software it is something that I can now say I have experience with and something
that could be useful in my future career.
