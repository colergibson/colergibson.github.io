# Project Responsibilities
For the presentation I was responsible for the history and introduction as well 
as the takeaways. I was also responsible for most of the troubleshooting and 
discovery of how to properly format the slides as well as how to get the audio 
files where we needed them to be. Celine was responsible for the applications 
portion of the assignment as well as the design and font layouts. She also 
provided audio for the shared header sliders.

# My Process
During my work for this project I started by researching various 3D printing 
technologies and timelines to get a better understanding on where the technology
has developed from. After doing much of my research I began to create my slides 
and outline my script. I chose to go for a more visual route with pictures 
outlining my speech. A lot of my time was spent working with the formatting to 
get the timing and spacing that I wanted. Also because of my presentation style 
I spent a good amount of time working with Audacity and learning how to capture 
my audio as well as to learn how to edit it so that it would line up with my 
slides. During this process Celine and I were working on her slides and 
fragmented text within a single slide and luckily after a few trial and error 
moments we learned that you can insert audio directly into a paragraph tag which
helped immensely. 

# Challenges
I also decided to include a video into my presentation and because of this I had
to work with Windows Movie Maker to edit the video down to the time that I 
wished for it to play. Initially I tried to use the code provided to make it 
start and stop when I wanted and I was successful when activating the video 
myself. However when used with autoplay the video would start from the 
beginning. Luckily the software was very similar in structure to Audacity and I 
was able to quickly achieve my desires and get the video edited down to the 
portion that I wished to use.

# Skills and Attitudes
I feel like this project was incredibly helpful in terms of bringing all of the 
skills from the class together. It required a knowledge of html and markdown as 
well as incorporating a new skill with audio generation and presentation through
a new medium. I also found myself actively interested in creating this 
presentation as it was much more straightforward and I felt like I could better 
use the space than I would when using something like Powerpoint. I actually 
think that in the future I would prefer to use reveal.js again. I also found 
things like Github and Cloud9 to be incredibly useful for my other classes. As 
Iâ€™m in a programming class I was able to use these products to better share my 
code and work with other classmates as well as my professor. Finally I think 
that this class helped to foster an interest in learning new technologies that 
I normally would of avoided. I normally would not be prone to use open source 
software as I was skeptical of the support and stability of these services but 
my class has helped to educate me on how these software actually are provided 
for and maintained.
