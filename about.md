# My Background 

I am from [Pilot Mountain, North Carolina](https://goo.gl/maps/Rd9FxrRk7rJ2)
It is a small town in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. I was an active 
member of the music community as I was a student in piano for 10 years while 
also being a member of the high school band as a trumpet player. 

I enrolled at High Point University in the fall of 2011 for my undergraduate 
degree where I focused on English Literature but continued my music by playing 
in the university band and pep band for the entirity of my education. I was also
a member of Sigma Tau Delta which was an English Honor Society and served as 
President for my Junior and Senior years.

I enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fall of 
2015 for my masters degree in library science.

I currently reside in [Chapel Hill,North Carolina](https://goo.gl/maps/EThrhJAdWMP2).

I am currently a second year Masters of Library Science student studying at 
the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

# My Career Aspirations

I'm currently aiming to find work in a technical services department in a 
library primarily within an academic library. I also have an interest for 
working within an archive or special collection.

# Hobbies and Interests
While I am a graduate student and that takes up a majority of my time I do have
interests that I like to pursue in my free time. 

**Gaming**

- I am an avid gamer who mainly plays on the Xbox One for achievements but I do 
have a Nintendo Wii U as well as a large library of Steam games. 
If you are interested in my virtual exploits I have included a link to my 
Gamercard from TrueAchievements.com

**Music**

- I also am an active musician who tries to find any opportunity I can to play.
While I mainly play trumpet for churches I am also well practiced in piano and
often will assist with a summer music camp that I have help run for the last
12 years. Here is a brief video of the High Point University pep band playing at a NASCAR
truck event that I was a member of.
