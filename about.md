# My Background 

I am from [Pilot Mountain, North Carolina](https://goo.gl/maps/Rd9FxrRk7rJ2)
It is a small town in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. I was an active 
member of the music community as I was a student in piano for 10 years while 
also being a member of the high school band as a trumpet player. 

I enrolled at High Point University in the fall of 2011 for my undergraduate 
degree where I focused on English Literature but continued my music by playing 
in the university band and pep band for the entirity of my education. I was also
a member of Sigma Tau Delta which was an English Honor Society and served as 
President for my Junior and Senior years.

I enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fall of 
2015 for my masters degree in library science.
